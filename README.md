# Twitter-Simple-ChatBot

here, I created a Chatbot using twitter API through Tweepy library that gets triggered if someone mentions the bot account
Programmed the bot to check if the mention has hi or hello then retweet to the sender “hello back to you” in 15secs or less
Implemented the code in a 24/7 running website called "PythonAnywhere" instead of having Anaconda editor open with constant internet connection

this is the link for the PythonAnywhere where you can simply run the program and test it by mentioning the developer Bot account "@ninaz221198"
in order for the bot to respond; the mention must contain a "hi" or "hello" or even "#helloworld"
